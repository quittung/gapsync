if both directories are mounted on your system:
    python3 gapsync *source_dir* *target_dir* -p
    
if the directories are on separate systems, follow this three step process:
    1. scanning the target directory
        python3 gapsync *target_dir* -o target.json
        this creates a list of files and their hashes and saves it as 'scan.json'
        send this file to the person performing step 2

    2. preparing the patch data
        python3 gapsync *source_dir* target.json -d *data_dir*
        this compares the source data to the scan of the target data
        then it collects all necessary data in *data_dir*
        send that directory to the person performing the next step

    3. patching the target directory
        python3 gapsync *target_dir* -d *data_dir* -p
        this checks the data directory and applies the patch
        then it verifies the target directory is identical to the source
        to perform a dry run without changing files, remove the '-p'
